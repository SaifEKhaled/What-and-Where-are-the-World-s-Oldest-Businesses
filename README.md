4. **Merging and Filtering Data:** Merges all businesses, countries, and categories, and filters businesses in North America.

5. **Grouping and Aggregation:** Groups data by continent and counts the missing countries, and groups businesses by category and counts the oldest businesses.

6. **Data Filtering:** Filters businesses founded before 1800 in the 'CAT4' category and sorts the results.

7. **Data Merging and Sorting:** Merges all businesses, countries, and categories together and sorts them from the oldest to the most recent.
